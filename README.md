# EB LISP

This is my lisp interpreter. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Seriously though, I could have used an existing one, but I had a specialized use case in mind, and besides, it's not hard to write a lisp interpreter.


For now, the parser is very minimal and only handles simple expressions, but one can have plenty of fun with an expression parser! Take a look at the environment definition in lisp.cpp to see what subroutines are supported.
